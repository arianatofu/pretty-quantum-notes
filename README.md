## pretty-quantum-notes ㅤ♡
A cute visual notebook for learning quantum mechanics and quantum devices through gentle derivations, simple simulations, and approachable explanations. Great for beginners new to quantum or those needing an easy reference!

These notes are written from a physics student’s perspective, with an emphasis
on clarity and simplicity.

## why was pretty-quantum-notes born? ㅤㅤ♡ ㅤㅤㅤ
Quantum has always scared and intrigued me all at the same time. And let's be honest it's not known to be easy to understand or get the first time around. I wanted a space where I could slow down, write things out cleanly, and pair math with pictures and small simulations so I was no longer intimidated!

This repository is both a learning tool for me and a resource for others who prefer a calmer, cuter, more visual approach to physics.

## what’s all inside? ㅤ♡
- Definitions of quantum conceptsㅤ
- Short derivations
- Simple Python simulations
- Visual intuition for quantum systems
- Notes focused on quantum devices

## topics (growing!!!) ㅤ♡
- Particle in a box
- Quantum wells and confinement
- Energy levels and scaling
- (Later) resonators, loss, and geometry intuition

## tools ㅤ♡
- Python
- numpy
- matplotlib
- Jupyter notebooks

## current status ㅤ♡
This is a living notebook and will grow slowly over time. Please be patient!
